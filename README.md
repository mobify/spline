## Requirements

- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) 3.4+

## Installation

Spline is distributed with the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager.

1. Install the NPM package

    Paste this command into your command line in your project's root directory:

    ```
    npm install spline --save-dev
    ```

    > **Note:** You'll need to have [Node and NPM installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) to run this command.

2. Import Spline at the beginning of your Sass stylesheet

    ```scss
    @import "node_modules/spline/spline";
    ```

Packages installed through NPM aren't made to be edited. If you need to edit or change anything within Spline, please consider [opening an issue or a PR](http://github.com/mobify/spline/issues) and having it added directly to the project itself.

## Updating

Spline follows [Semantic Versioning](http://www.semver.org). In a nutshell, that means that upgrading to new point releases (eg. moving from 1.0 to 1.1) is safe. Upgrading to new major releases (from 1.0 to 2.0) will cause backwards-incompatible changes.

To update Spline, paste the following command into your command line in your project's root:

```
npm update spline
```

## Browser Support

Spline is written for mobile browsers. This means that Spline should support newer desktop browsers as well but old browser support is not a priority. Spline does not contain any browser prefixing. If you're looking for prefixing, we recommend you use [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) in addition to Spline.

- iOS 6+
- Android Browser 2.3+
- Chrome for Android 35+

Other browsers may be supported but Spline is not actively developed on them. If you find any issues with specific browsers, please log them in our [Issues tracker](http://github.com/mobify/spline/issues).

## How To Test

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `grunt`
3. Ensure that all the `DEBUG` output in your terminal are all passing
4. Open `test/index.html` in your browser
5. Ensure all the tests descriptions are accurate compared to how the styles render
